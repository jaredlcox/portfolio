				<h2>JARED COX</h2>
				<p>I am an aspiring software engineer located in Temperance, MI.</p>
				<br>
				<p>As a student at Thinkful, I have finally found what I'm truly passionate about. I had always thought working in the tech field was not really something I was meant to do, until I began writing my first lines of code as a student at Thinkful. As I progress, I have found a passion for software development that I have never imagined having. Whether it be with fellow peers in a Discord chat or with my mentor, Praveen, I truly love being able to work through difficult problems, and enjoy doing it in the process. The two main skills I have acquired as a student at Thinkful are the following:
				<br>
					<ol>
						<li>Learning how to work well with others</li>
						<li>Communicating effectively with fellow
						peers.</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
