				<h2>JARED COX</h2>
			<p>I am an aspiring software engineer located in Temperance, MI. Throughout my years of schooling I had never met a
				software develepor. I had never taken any classes in software development, and therefore did not have an opportunity
				to dive into this field. I knew I had some interests in the medical/science field, so I enrolled into the field of
				Biochemistry at the Univerity of Toledo. I did well, but realized I simply did not have enough interest to continue
				studying tirelessly as if it were my full-time job. Although I developed many skills that will translate into the
				software engineering field. I would say the three main skills I acquired during my college years were the following:
				<ol>
					<li>Working well with others in a lab.</li>
					<li>Quickly solving complex problems.</li>
					<li>Communicating effectively with fellow peers.</li>
				</ol>
				Although I was learning something new every day, I decided that I needed to begin my search for a more exciting option that better fit my interests. That decision led me to Thinkful, and I couldn't be happier that I found this course! I believe that the skills and knowledge I gained at the University of Toledo, along with what I'm continually learning at Thinkful, will help me land my dream job!</p>
