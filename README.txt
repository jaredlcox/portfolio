  			<p>I am an aspiring software engineer located in Temperance, MI. Throughout my years of schooling I had never met a software develepor. I had never taken any classes in software development, and therefore did not have an opportunity to dive into this field. I knew I had some interests in the medical/science field, so I enrolled into the field of Biochemistry at the Univerity of Toledo. I did well, but realized I simply did not have enough interest to continue studying tirelessly as if it were my full-time job. Although I developed many skills that will translate into the software engineering field, such as working well with others in a lab, I decided to begin my search for more exciting options that better fit my interests.  That led me to Thinkful, and I couldn't be happie that I found this course! I believe that the skills and knowledge I gained at the University of Toledo, along with what I'm continually learning at Thinkful, will help me land my dream job!</p>
